# Visual Attention for Event Cameras based on Spiking Neural Network
In this repository:
  Adaptation of PyNN code, produced by Am√©lie Gruel in 2023, for event-based data input, specifically for the DVS128 Gesture dataset. This adaptation enables the 'LAVA' framework to simulate a Spiking Neural Network on Intel's 'Loihi' chip.
